## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — alpha

Initial public release: the producer/emission layer for the Agent Action Capsule
profile.

### Added
- `emit()` — one call to seal a content-addressed, digest-committed capsule of an agent
  action and its outcome (may/did verdict + confirmed-effect binding).
- Anchoring on by default — digest-only submission to a SCITT transparency log,
  recorded in an RFC 9162 transparency log (inclusion checkable against the log;
  surfacing the receipt onto the result is roadmap); repointable via `AAC_ANCHOR_URL`
  / `anchor_url=`, disable with `anchor=False`.
- Chaining via `confirms=` (parent linkage; `approved → executed → confirmed`).
- Layer capture: `agent_input`, `agent_output`, `model`, and compute attestation
  digest-committed into the capsule.
- Framework adapters: MCP (`@emitter.tool`), LangChain callback, CrewAI `wrap()`,
  Hermes — over one shared `CapsuleEmitterBase`.
- `manifest.md` declaration parser (declare autonomy + constraints; enforcement
  is a downstream, same-file concern).
- `capsule-emit ledger view` CLI over the local append-only JSONL ledger.
- Apache-2.0 license; neutrality CI gate; product-free substrate.
