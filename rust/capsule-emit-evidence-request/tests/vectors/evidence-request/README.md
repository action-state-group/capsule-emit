# Evidence request conformance vectors (draft-mih-agent-evidence-request-00)

Conformance vectors for the evidence request interaction defined in
`spec/draft-mih-agent-evidence-request-00.md`: the request map, the six subject
forms, coverage, the request digest, the signed refusal, the three outcomes and
the pending state, caller invariance, and retention commitments.

**Derived from the -00 text, not from any implementation.** Every expected
result is written by hand in the generator from the section it cites. The
generator only encodes inputs, hashes them and signs the refusal cases; it runs
no responder or verifier. Every case is marked `"provenance": "spec-derived"`.
Where -00 leaves a choice open, the case carries an `ambiguity` note with the
section and the reading used (the most literal one); the list is below, for -01.

## Files

| File | What it pins |
|---|---|
| `registry.json` | The exact strings -00 fixes: request fields and their presence, the six subject forms, the two coverage members, the eight refusal reasons, the `history_card/1` derivation, the three outcomes, the pending state, the `evidence-request/1` subprotocol identifier. |
| `request.json` | Request map validation. Each case gives the request as JSON (RFC 8785 text, `request_json`) and, where it is a CBOR value, as a deterministic CBOR frame (`request_cbor_hex`), with the SHA-256 of each. Expect `well_formed: true`, or `false` with the exact refusal reason. |
| `resolution.json` | Exact-match resolution against one declared responder state (`responder`, with per-case `responder_overrides`). Expect `artifact` or a refusal with the most specific reason (§4.2). |
| `digest.json` | The request digest is over the bytes as received (§4.2 item 1): JSON and CBOR, deterministic and not, and a refusal carrying the digest of a re-canonicalized form. |
| `refusal.json` | Signed refusals: one per registered reason, a CBOR response frame, tampering, and objects that are signed but not conforming. Carries the signature profile and both fixed keys (seed and public key). |
| `refusal-imported.json` | An existing cross-implementation refusal vector, byte for byte (SHA-256 `885d7981…a66e`). It conforms to -00: a request digest, a registered reason, an issuance time, and a signature over all three. |
| `outcomes.json` | The three outcomes and pending, as facts in and one state out, with the states each case must never be recorded as (§4.5). |
| `invariance.json` | Caller invariance (§5): observations of the same subject under the same anchor must carry byte-identical artifacts. |
| `retention.json` | Retention commitments (§9): every reason inside and after `until`, absence with and without a commitment, and which subject forms a commitment may name. |
| `manifest.json` | SHA-256 and case count of every generated file, and the ambiguity list. |
| `SHA256SUMS` | SHA-256 of every file in this directory except itself. |
| `DIFFS.md` | Known differences between one existing Python responder and -00. |

## Conventions

- Digests are SHA-256, 64 lowercase hex characters, as text in both bindings
  (**A2**).
- A subject is a map with one member named by the form token (**A1**):
  `{"full_history": null}`, `{"checkpoints": null}`, `{"record": <digest>}`,
  `{"range": [a, b]}`, `{"correlation": "<id>"}`, `{"exchange": <digest>}`.
- Coverage is `{"expected_pin": <digest>}` or `{"min_freshness": <size or time>}`
  (**A3**).
- Refusals use the signature profile in `refusal.json` (**A7**): Ed25519 over
  the RFC 8785 serialization of `{issued_at, reason, request_digest}`, with
  `key_id` (raw public key) and `sig` in lowercase hex. The keys are derived
  from fixed seeds, so every signature is reproducible.
- `issued_at`, `deadline` and `min_freshness` times are RFC 3339 UTC strings
  (**A5**).
- Resolution cases expect the most specific reason (§4.2). The one case with a
  uniform `policy_declined` posture (§4.2, §12) says so in `responder_overrides`.

## How to consume them

1. Check the pinned hashes first: `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS` in this directory,
   or compare each file with `manifest.json`. A copy vendored into another
   repository should be checked against this `SHA256SUMS` in its CI.
2. `request.json`: feed `request_json` (UTF-8 bytes) to a JSON-binding parser,
   and the bytes of `request_cbor_hex` to a CBOR-binding parser. Both must give
   the expected result. The digest of the bytes fed must equal
   `request_json_digest` / `request_cbor_digest`.
3. `resolution.json`: load `responder` (plus any `responder_overrides`) as the
   responder's holdings, and check the answer's form and reason.
4. `refusal.json`: verify each `refusal` object (or the `file`) offline.
   `expect.signature` is the signature check alone, `expect.reason_registered`
   the registry check alone, and `expect.conformant` both plus the presence and
   form of every member §4.2 requires. Keep the two checks separate: a valid
   signature over an unregistered token is still the responder's signed act.
5. `outcomes.json`: map `facts` to a state; it must equal `expect.state` and
   must not be any of `expect.must_not_record_as`.
6. `invariance.json`: for observations with the same `resolved_anchor`, the
   `artifact_hex` values must be identical. Differing verification material is
   allowed. Different anchors are `not_comparable`.
7. `retention.json`: classify each `facts` pair, and check each `commitment` for
   well-formedness.

Regenerate from the repository root with
`python3 python/scripts/generate_evidence_request_vectors.py`. The output is a
pure function of that script (no clock, no randomness);
`python/tests/test_evidence_request_vectors.py` re-runs it and requires
byte-identical files. `README.md` and `DIFFS.md` are hand-written; the
generator hashes them into `SHA256SUMS` but never rewrites them.

## Ambiguities in -00 (for -01)

Each is marked on the cases it affects. The vectors follow the reading given.

- **A1** §3.1 Subject: -00 gives six forms and their content but no wire shape. Vectors use a map with exactly one member, named by the form token, whose value is the content: null for full_history and checkpoints, a digest for record and exchange, [a, b] (two unsigned integers) for range, a text string for correlation.
- **A2** §3.1, §3.2, §4.2: -00 names digests but not the hash algorithm or representation. Vectors use SHA-256 as 64 lowercase hex characters, as text in both the JSON and CBOR bindings.
- **A3** §3.2 Coverage: min_freshness is 'size or time' with no shape. Vectors read the value itself: an unsigned integer is a log size, a text string is an RFC 3339 UTC time. Any other type is not a conforming value.
- **A4** §3 / §3.2: coverage_unsatisfiable is assigned for 'both, or neither'. Vectors read an absent coverage field as 'neither' (coverage_unsatisfiable), and a coverage value that is not a map, or a member whose value does not conform, as request_malformed.
- **A5** §3.4-§3.6: deadline, nonce and route have no stated type. Vectors use text strings (deadline as an RFC 3339 UTC time).
- **A6** §3.1 range: -00 does not say whether a > b is malformed. Vectors treat it as a value that does not conform (request_malformed).
- **A7** §4.2 / §10: -00 names the refusal's contents but no member names or signature format. Vectors use request_digest, reason, issued_at, key_id and sig with the signature profile in refusal.json. In the CBOR binding the same map is the frame; the signature is still over the RFC 8785 body.
- **A8** §4.3 / §10: the stream binding says absence is 'the stream closed or timed out without a response frame'; §4.3 says only the close of the waiting window resolves a request. Vectors follow §4.3: a transport failure inside the window leaves the request pending.
- **A9** §9: -00 lists retention_expired only as the correct refusal after until. Inside until, vectors apply the literal 'any other refusal reason' rule: it is a breach.
- **A10** §9: after until, -00 names only retention_expired as correct. Vectors class the four request/capability reasons, policy_declined and deadline_unmet as no breach, and no_such_subject as the wrong token (the lapsed promise must not read as never held, §4.2 item 2).
- **A11** §9: 'a digest or a position under a checkpoint'. Vectors read full_history, checkpoints and correlation subjects in a commitment as malformed.
- **A12** §4.1: the artifact envelope has no member names. Invariance cases compare artifact bytes only; the observation members are local to these vectors.
- **A13** §4.2 item 2 / §4.5: -00 does not say what a correctly signed object with an unregistered reason is. Vectors: not a conforming refusal, and still never recorded as absence.
- **A14** §3.3: a registered derivation token and the digest of a definition share one field. Vectors tell them apart by form: a token has a '/N' suffix, a digest is 64 lowercase hex.
